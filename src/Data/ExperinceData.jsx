      "Cradled in North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains, Lake Toxaway is a 640-acre, stream-fed lake with 14 miles of pristine shoreline—the largest private lake in the state. Fed by clear mountain waters from the Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests, it’s known for exceptionally clean, glassy-blue water and a constant elevation of about 3,000 feet, creating a cool, refreshing climate in every season.",

      "Just beyond Lake Toxaway, the storied French Broad River winds its way north through the mountains, carving a broad valley of farms, forests, and small mountain towns. Rising in nearby Transylvania County, this ancient river meanders past Brevard and Asheville on its journey toward Tennessee, offering miles of water perfect for paddling, fly-fishing, and lazy summer floats. A day on the French Broad pairs beautifully with a stay at Lake Toxaway—linking quiet, glassy lake mornings with the adventurous spirit of one of the South’s great mountain rivers.",

      "Step back in time and experience Lake Toxaway the way it was meant to be enjoyed—aboard a classic wooden boat. From the moment you step onto the varnished deck, the pace of life slows: the engine hums softly, the mountains reflect in the water, and the shoreline drifts by in a quiet panorama of trees and sky. Whether you’re planning a sunset cruise, a leisurely daytime tour, or a special celebration on the water, our wooden boat rentals offer a nostalgic, one-of-a-kind way to explore North Carolina’s largest private lake.",
